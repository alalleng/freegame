## Purpose
This repository is for **educational and illustrative purposes only**. It demonstrates how infrastructure as code (IaC), open-source tools, and AI-driven workflows could theoretically be integrated into a unified system. The templates and code are not tested for production use and are not guaranteed to function as described.

## System Requirements
To explore the concepts, you may need the following tools (if testing locally):
- **Azure Account:** For Bicep template deployment (optional for theory demonstration).
- **Access to GitHub:** To browse referenced repositories.
- **CLI Tools:** Azure CLI, Docker, and Kubernetes (optional).

## Installation (Theoretical)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd free-game
   ```
2. Review the Azure Bicep template:
   ```bash
   cat main.bicep
   ```
3. Hypothetical deployment:
   ```bash
   az deployment group create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --template-file main.bicep
   ```
4. Hypothetical integration:
   - Deploy a conceptual XAMPP virtual machine.
   - Integrate IPFS for decentralized storage.
   - Containerize and explore text analytics tools in a hypothetical AKS environment.

## Algorithm Comparison: FreeGame vs FreeGame2 
   CoPilot said all this - I just thought the first one was wrong and wasn't gonna deploy at all and still think so...

In this section, we compare the algorithms used in the `freegame` and `freegame2` projects. Each algorithm has its own advantages and specific use cases.
